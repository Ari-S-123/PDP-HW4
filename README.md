# Chat Room

A simple chat room app built with React, Vite, Express, and Socket.io.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

2. Make sure you are using the latest Node LTS version at the time of the last commit [v22.x].

3. Run `npm i -g pnpm@latest-10` to install pnpm.

4. Run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

## Building

To create and run a production version of the app:

1. Run `pnpm build` to create an optimized production build of the app.

2. Run the backend server with `pnpm run server`.

3. You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview -- open` and open the app in a new browser tab.

## Developing

1. Run the backend server with `pnpm run server`.

2. Run `pnpm dev --open` to start the frontend development server and open the app in a new browser tab.

## Linting

1. Run `pnpm lint` to run prettier and eslint.

2. Run `pnpm format` to format with prettier.

## AI Usage

I used Cursor in Agent mode with `claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking`, `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`, and also Tab Autocomplete to help me with various aspects of this project:

1. **Type/Model Definitions**: AI helped design and implement well-structured TypeScript type definitions for the application.

2. **Code Refactoring**: AI provided suggestions for refactoring code.

3. **Bug Detection**: AI identified potential logical issues and type mismatches that were fixed during development.

4. **UI Generation**: AI helped a lot with building lots of frontend components with proper styling quickly.

5. **Docs Generation**: AI helped a lot with writing consistent JSDoc throughout the codebase.

Some prompts I used:

- Help me fix the bug with duplicate messages.
- Help me fix the bug with incorrect system messages on change username.
- Help me fix the bug with some messages not being in chronological order when a new user joins.
- Move the type definitions of Message and ReadRecipt into dedicated files within the types folder.
- Help me extract the inner components within @App.tsx into dedicated files within the components folder.
- Clean up the UI, add more padding/margin, make the button sizes more consistent, make the chat fill up the whole horizontal space, etc.
- Add JSDoc style comments for the new components in the same way it has been done in the rest of the codebase.

Everything generated by the Agent was manually verified and/or edited by me to ensure it was correct and working as expected.
